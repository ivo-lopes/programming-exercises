txt = '''So, get away
Another way to feel what you didn't want yourself to know
And let yourself go
You know you didn't lose your self-control
Let's start at the rainbow
Turn away
Another way to be where you didn't want yourself to go
Let yourself go
Is that a compromise
So what do you wanna do, what's your point-of-view?
There's a party soon, do you wanna go?
A handshake with you, what's your point-of-view?
I'm on top of you, I don't wanna go
'Cause I really wanna stay at your house
And I hop–µ this works out
But you know how much you broke me apart
I'm done with you, I'm ignoring you
I don't wanna know'''
